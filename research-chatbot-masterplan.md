# Research Paper Chatbot - Project Masterplan

## 1. Project Overview
A command-line conversational AI tool that helps researchers analyze and explore academic papers in the computer vision domain. The system ingests PDF documents, enables natural conversations about their content, and provides relevant external paper recommendations when needed.

### Objectives
- Create a user-friendly CLI tool for research paper analysis
- Enable contextual conversations about paper content
- Provide source-tracked responses from document content
- Offer relevant paper recommendations from academic databases
- Support easy switching between different LLM providers

## 2. Target Audience
- Researchers and developers working in computer vision
- Users comfortable with command-line interfaces
- People conducting literature reviews and research exploration

## 3. Core Features and Functionality

### 3.1 Document Processing
- Bulk PDF ingestion (supporting ~50 papers + textbooks)
- Document text extraction and chunking
- Source reference tracking
- Vector embedding for efficient retrieval

### 3.2 Conversational Interface
- Contextual conversation handling
- Built-in query templates for common research tasks:
  - Paper summarization
  - Method comparison
  - Dataset analysis
  - Implementation approaches
- Source citation in responses
- Markdown-formatted output for readability

### 3.3 External Research Integration
- Integration with academic databases (arXiv, etc.)
- Paper recommendation based on conversation context
- Abstract retrieval for recommended papers

## 4. Technical Stack Recommendations

### 4.1 Core Components
- **Document Processing**: PyPDF2 or PDFMiner.six for PDF extraction
- **Text Chunking**: LangChain's text splitters
- **Vector Store**: Chroma DB (local storage, good for small-medium datasets)
- **Embeddings**: Sentence Transformers (local) or OpenAI embeddings
- **LLM Integration**: 
  - Primary: OpenAI GPT-4 (large context window, strong technical understanding)
  - Alternative: Anthropic Claude (excellent for academic content)
  - LLM wrapper layer for easy provider switching

### 4.2 Development Stack
- Python for core implementation
- Click or Typer for CLI interface
- Rich library for formatted terminal output
- SQLite for metadata storage

## 5. Data Model

### 5.1 Document Store
